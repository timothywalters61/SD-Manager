SD Manager is a platform that startups can use to manage their software design projects. You can either be a product owner, by creating a project, or a developer, by being added to a project. This way, product owners and developers can collaborate on creating software. SD Manager can be used to implement SCRUM and monitor sprint details such as which user stories are to be implemented.
