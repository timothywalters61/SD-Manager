# SD-Manager
SD Manager is a platform that students can use to manage their software design projects. Lecturers, who act as product owners, can also use this platform to verify sprint details such as which user stories are to be implemented. This platform can be used to award sprint marks accordingly since sprint details need to be verified by the product owner before any changes are saved. This helps prevent students from changing the backlog to suit what they've managed to do over the course of a sprint. Students can also communicate with their product through this platform to make any queries. The head lecturer of the course can also access a group's backlog and track changes made to the backlog to help with awarding marks.   A website and mobile app will be required for SD Manager to provide more convenience. The web version will be done in the first semester and the mobile app in the second semester. Both the front and back end will need to be developed.

SD Manager is a platform that startups can use to manage their software design projects. You can either be a product owner, by creating a project, or a developer, by being added to a project. This way, product owners and developers can collaborate on creating software. SD Manager can be used to implement SCRUM and monitor sprint details such as which user stories are to be implemented.
