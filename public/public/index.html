                    Software Design Manager is a platform that software developers can use to manage their projects.
                    Make your dream app a reality and start a new project where you and your dev team can keep track
                    of project progress and define new tasks for each sprint. As a project owner you can also
                    monitor each team members backlog to make sure that they are on track for project completion and
                    are finishing their assigned tasks in time. With this platform you can connect developers from
                    anywhere around the world and manage them as if they where working in the same building.

                    Become a project owner by creating a brand new project and inviting developers to join
                    your team. Split your project up into sprints, assign user stories to the sprints and use
                    Software Design manager to make your idea into a working app. Is one project not enough?
                    Don't worry because you can manage multiple projects at the same time if a little extra
                    work doesn't scare you.

                    Knowing what to do is super easy with Software Design Manager, just check what unfinished
                    user stories you have left for the sprint and make sure they are finished by the time the
                    sprint is through. Have a great idea of your own for an app? Just create a new project and
                    become a project owner yourself.
